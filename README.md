# Tchamba.random
Tchamba.random, is a real random data genarator (letters, jokes, names...)

## The idea
The name was invented by my friends Hammadi Ilyes and Bahri Aimene, and it was a joke. Now [we] are trying to implement it in order to get a random data.

## Installation
*not uploaded to pip repositories yet*, when it will be ready it will be installable by typing:
```bash
  pip install tchamba
```
## Contributing
If you have an idea, please feel free to submit an issue, or fork this project and add your **awesome_random_function** in [tchamba.py](tchamba/tchamba.py) file.
I think that we need something cool, funny like this :smile: to use it in our programs, for testing or for fun.
